# 8-bit-ascii-count
# These python programs receive data either from typed text or from the fortune command
# convert it to an 8 bit number that corresponds to it's assci code, transmits across the GPIO ports
# of a Raspberry PI to be received by another PI's GPIO to be converted back from ascii, to the standard output.
#

#
# It is used to demonstrate how data travels down an 8 bit bus, for a High School Freshmen Informations Systems class.
# 
# It is comprised of a client, and a server
#
# There are also dedicated clients and servers which I will also upload.
#

# I will also upload GPIO pinouts to aid in the physical setup of the app.
